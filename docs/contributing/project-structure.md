# Project Structure

This is the authoritative repo map for **NomiFun**. It tells you which
directory holds what, what each Rust crate is responsible for, and the one
architectural rule that keeps the agent engine extractable. For the
deep-dive on backend layering see
[`../architecture/backend-crates.md`](../architecture/backend-crates.md);
for the runtime story (how the two app hosts boot the same backend) see
[`../architecture/overview.md`](../architecture/overview.md).

The Cargo workspace members are exactly:

```toml
[workspace]
resolver = "3"
members = ["crates/agent/*", "crates/backend/*", "crates/shared/*", "apps/web", "apps/desktop"]
```

`crates/shared/*` is now active. Keep new shared crates rare: if a crate belongs
only to the backend or only to the agent engine, keep it in that owning group.

## App hosts

| Path | Binary | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`apps/web`](../../apps/web) | `nomifun-web` | Standalone server. Boots the unified backend in-process and serves the built SPA from the same port. Authentication on by default; `--insecure-no-auth` opts back into the desktop trust model. Replaces the old Node `web-host`. |
| [`apps/desktop`](../../apps/desktop) | `nomifun-desktop` | Tauri shell. Picks a free localhost port, starts the same backend in-process, injects `window.__backendPort` and `window.__nomiLocalTrust`, and loads the SPA into the WebView. Single-instance + dialog + notification + deep-link + updater plugins registered. |

Both hosts link `nomifun-app` directly — there is no spawned `nomicore`
binary in either flow. The `nomicore` binary still exists as the
`[[bin]]` of `nomifun-app` for headless / CI use and for the
`nomicore doctor` self-check.

## Crate groups

The Rust crates are grouped by origin and naming convention. The grouping
is the migration unit: each top-level directory under `crates/` corresponds
to a future independent repository.

| Directory | Prefix | Count | Role | Future repo |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`crates/agent/`](../../crates/agent) | `nomi-*` | 15 | AI agent engine. Self-contained — no dependency on any `nomifun-*` crate. | historical extraction target |
| [`crates/backend/`](../../crates/backend) | `nomifun-*` | 29 | HTTP/WS server, data layer, auth, sessions, cron, knowledge, terminal, companion, public gateway, ... | historical extraction target |
| [`crates/shared/`](../../crates/shared) | mixed | 2 | Cross-layer utilities used by both sides. | shared |

## The agent-layer seam

Backend feature code should normally go through
[`crates/backend/nomifun-ai-agent`](../../crates/backend/nomifun-ai-agent)
when it needs agent types or agent execution. Most backend crates import
agent-facing types via
`nomifun_ai_agent::{nomi_config, nomi_types, RequirementSink}`.

The current workspace has feature-gated direct-dependency exceptions in
`nomifun-app` and `nomifun-gateway` for browser/computer-use bridge tooling.
When you add a new backend crate that needs an agent type:

1. Prefer not to add `nomi-* = ...` to your `Cargo.toml`.
2. Re-export what you need through `nomifun-ai-agent` or use what is already
   re-exported there.
3. Consume it via `use nomifun_ai_agent::nomi_types::...;` etc.
4. If a direct dependency is required for a bridge/facade, gate it behind a
   feature and document the exception in the crate manifest and architecture
   docs.

Why: this keeps the agent engine mostly independent and prevents feature crates
from silently tying themselves to engine internals.

## `apps/web` and `apps/desktop`

Both app crates are thin: they parse a small CLI, call into `nomifun-app`'s
public boot helpers, and own the shape of the host process.

```text
apps/web/src/main.rs         ~165 lines
  init runtime → init data layer → AppServices → create_router →
  ServeDir(ui/dist) fallback → axum::serve

apps/desktop/src/main.rs     ~250 lines
  pick free port → init runtime → spawn embedded backend on a tokio
  thread → tauri::Builder with single-instance/dialog/notification/
  deep-link/updater plugins → window init-script injects window.__backendPort
```

`nomifun-app` exposes the boot entry as a library: `bootstrap`, `cli`,
`commands`, and a `run_embedded_server` helper, plus `AppServices` and
`create_router`. The `nomicore` bin is just one of three consumers.

## `ui/` — the React SPA

The frontend is a single Bun workspace, built with **plain Vite + UnoCSS**
(no `electron-vite`).

| Path | What lives here |
| --- | --- |
| [`ui/src/common/`](../../ui/src/common) | Cross-host code reused regardless of shell: `adapter/` (HTTP / WS bridges), `api/`, `chat/`, `config/`, `platform/`, `types/`, `update/`, `utils/`, plus the package barrel `index.ts`. |
| [`ui/src/platform/`](../../ui/src/platform) | The tiny host-bridge layer: `bridge.ts`, `logger.ts`, `storage.ts`, `theme.ts`. The renderer never imports Tauri / Electron APIs directly — it goes through this layer. |
| [`ui/src/renderer/`](../../ui/src/renderer) | The app itself: `pages/`, `components/`, `hooks/`, `services/`, `styles/`, `utils/`, `assets/`, `main.tsx`, `index.html`, `types.d.ts`. |
| [`ui/src/common/utils/shims/`](../../ui/src/common/utils/shims) | Stubs for renderer-safe compatibility paths and build-time aliases. |
| [`ui/public/`](../../ui/public) | Static assets copied straight to `ui/dist/` (icons, etc.). |
| `ui/vite.config.ts` | Vite config, including the externalized-shim aliases. |
| `ui/uno.config.ts` | UnoCSS preset config. |
| `ui/tsconfig.json` | TypeScript paths and aliases that match the directory shape above. |
