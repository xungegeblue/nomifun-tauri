# Data and Storage

NomiFun keeps its state in three places: a SQLite database (the source of
truth for everything structured), a per-installation **data directory**
(database file, logs, OS-cached runtimes), and per-conversation **work
directories** that hold the files agents read and write. This page explains
what lives where, how it's named, and how it's protected.

## The data directory

| Host | Default path | Override |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop (`nomifun-desktop`) | Per-user app data: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NomiFun\Nomi` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/NomiFun/Nomi` on macOS, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/NomiFun/Nomi` (usually `~/.local/share/NomiFun/Nomi`) on Linux. With `NOMIFUN_DATA_DIR` set, becomes `$NOMIFUN_DATA_DIR/Nomi`. Legacy installs under `<system temp>/nomifun-data/Nomi` are auto-relocated on launch (one-shot; the old dir is kept as a backup). | env `NOMIFUN_DATA_DIR` |
| Web (`nomifun-web`) and the `nomicore` bin | The **same** per-user directory as the desktop shell — `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NomiFun\Nomi` / `~/Library/Application Support/NomiFun/Nomi` / `$XDG_DATA_HOME/NomiFun/Nomi` (the old `./data`-relative default is gone). With `NOMIFUN_DATA_DIR` set, the value is taken **literally** (no `/Nomi` suffix), so Docker `/data` and systemd `/var/lib/nomifun` deployments are unaffected. | flag `--data-dir` or env `NOMIFUN_DATA_DIR` |

Inside the data directory:

```
<data_dir>/
├── nomifun-backend.db   SQLite database (sqlx)
├── server.lock          exclusive server-lock address file (the lock lives on
│                        the open OS handle; a leftover file is harmless)
├── logs/                tracing-appender file output (rotated daily)
├── conversations/       per-conversation workspaces (see below)
└── companion/                 companion file domain (shared memory hub + per-companion profiles, see below)
```

All three hosts resolve the unset default through one shared helper,
[`nomifun_app::cli::default_data_dir()`](../../crates/backend/nomifun-app/src/cli.rs):
`dirs::data_local_dir()/NomiFun/Nomi` (the per-user application-data
location), with the system temp dir (`<system temp>/nomifun-data/Nomi`)
only as an extreme fallback when the OS reports no user dir. Env semantics
stay host-specific: the desktop shell appends `"Nomi"` to `NOMIFUN_DATA_DIR`
(see [`apps/desktop/src/main.rs`](../../apps/desktop/src/main.rs)), while
`nomifun-web` and `nomicore` take the env value literally (a clap `env`
binding — new for `nomicore`, which previously ignored the variable).
A pre-existing legacy install under `<system temp>/nomifun-data/Nomi` is
relocated to the new location once at launch
([`apps/desktop/src/relocate.rs`](../../apps/desktop/src/relocate.rs)):
data is copied (regenerable caches/logs are left behind), the legacy dir is
kept as a backup, and the backend then rewrites absolute paths stored in the
database (knowledge-base roots, conversation workspaces, terminal cwds) to
the new root.

### One directory, one state

Sharing one default across every host is deliberate: the dev loops
(`bun run serve:web`, `dev:web`, `dev`) and the installed desktop app
read and write the same state, so a provider or companion configured once is
testable everywhere, and troubleshooting only ever has one directory to
look at. When you *do* want an isolated sandbox, `NOMIFUN_DATA_DIR` or
`--data-dir` is the escape hatch. (The dev scripts no longer pass a
repo-relative `--data-dir`; the old `data/` and `.dev-data/` directories
are not read by anything and their contents are **not** auto-migrated —
copy them into the new root or point `NOMIFUN_DATA_DIR` back at them if
you still need them.)

What makes the sharing safe is an **exclusive server lock**: at boot
(`bootstrap::init_environment`, before the database is opened) the backend
takes an OS-level exclusive advisory lock on `{data_dir}/server.lock`
(`fs2`: `flock` on Unix, `LockFileEx` on Windows). The OS releases the lock
when the process exits *or crashes*, so a leftover `server.lock` file is
harmless and needs no staleness heuristics. A second backend on the same
directory fails fast with an error naming the holder (pid + exe) and the
two ways out: close the other instance, or point this one at its own
directory. The desktop shell now surfaces a backend-startup failure in a
native error dialog and exits (previously a silent white window).
`nomicore doctor` and the `mcp-*` stdio subcommands are unaffected by the
lock (`doctor` is designed to run alongside a live server).

## SQLite via `sqlx`

[`nomifun-db`](../../crates/backend/nomifun-db/) is the data layer. Highlights
from [`crates/backend/nomifun-db/src/lib.rs`](../../crates/backend/nomifun-db/src/lib.rs):

- `Database` — owns the `sqlx::SqlitePool` and the migrations. Exposed via
  `nomifun-db::SqlitePool` re-export.
- `init_database` — opens the file, runs embedded migrations.
- `init_database_memory` — in-memory variant used by tests.

The crate exposes ~20 repository **trait + Sqlite-impl** pairs. A non-exhaustive
list (see the `pub use repository::{...}` block in `lib.rs` for all of them):

| Trait | Sqlite implementation | Stores |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IUserRepository` | `SqliteUserRepository` | Users, password hashes, the system default user |
| `IConversationRepository` | `SqliteConversationRepository` | Conversations + messages, with filters and full-text search rows |
| `IAgentMetadataRepository` | `SqliteAgentMetadataRepository` | ACP handshake results, available models, agent-binary metadata |
| `IAcpSessionRepository` | `SqliteAcpSessionRepository` | Persistent ACP sessions for resume after restart |
| `IMcpServerRepository` | `SqliteMcpServerRepository` | Configured MCP servers (CRUD) |
| `IOAuthTokenRepository` | `SqliteOAuthTokenRepository` | Encrypted OAuth tokens for HTTP MCP servers |
| `IProviderRepository` | `SqliteProviderRepository` | LLM provider credentials (encrypted) |
| `IRemoteAgentRepository` | `SqliteRemoteAgentRepository` | Remote-agent endpoints |
| `ITeamRepository` | `SqliteTeamRepository` | Multi-agent teams, tasks, mailbox state |
| `IRequirementRepository` | `SqliteRequirementRepository` | AutoWork requirements (intentionally **no foreign key** to conversations — the loop survives conversation deletion) |
| `ICronRepository` | `SqliteCronRepository` | Scheduled tasks and their timezone-normalized expressions |
| `ITerminalRepository` | `SqliteTerminalRepository` | Terminal session metadata |
| `IAssistantRepository` / `IAssistantOverrideRepository` | `SqliteAssistantRepository` / `SqliteAssistantOverrideRepository` | Assistants and per-installation overrides |
| `IChannelRepository` | `SqliteChannelRepository` | External chat-channel plugin configs (Telegram / Lark / DingTalk / WeChat) |
| `IClientPreferenceRepository` | `SqliteClientPreferenceRepository` | Per-client preferences |
| `ITagSettingRepository` | `SqliteTagSettingRepository` | Tag-based grouping (used by AutoWork) |
| `ISettingsRepository` | `SqliteSettingsRepository` | Misc app settings |
| `IWebhookRepository` | `SqliteWebhookRepository` | Outbound webhook destinations (Lark) |

A few row-update params types travel alongside (`UpdateAgentHandshakeParams`,
`ConversationFilters`, `ConversationRowUpdate`, `MessageRowUpdate`,
`MessageSearchRow`, `UpdateCronJobParams`, `UpsertOAuthTokenParams`,
`CreateProviderParams`, `UpdateRemoteAgentParams`, `UpdateTeamParams`,
`UpdateTaskParams`, etc.). The repository traits are the contract; everything
above the data layer talks to them, never to the pool directly.

### Migrations

Migrations are SQL files embedded with `sqlx::migrate!`. They run on every
boot inside `init_database`. Schemas evolve forward only; downgrades are not
supported.

### Per-conversation foreign-key note

`requirements` (the AutoWork queue) intentionally has **no foreign key** on
`conversation_id`. The AutoWork orchestrator (`nomifun-requirement`) is
backend-authoritative and survives conversation deletion — the FK would couple
its lifecycle to the conversation's, defeating the boot-resume design. (See
the user memory entry "AutoWork backend-authoritative".)

## Encryption at rest — AES-GCM

Sensitive strings (provider API keys, OAuth tokens, channel-bot tokens, ...)
are encrypted before insertion using AES-256-GCM via
`nomifun_common::crypto::{encrypt_string, decrypt_string}` and the
encryption key derived in `nomifun_app::derive_encryption_key`.

The master key is not a file: `derive_encryption_key` is the SHA-256 of the
JWT secret, which is resolved at boot as env `JWT_SECRET` → the system
user's `jwt_secret` column → freshly generated and persisted to the
database. The key is per-installation and never crosses the wire; losing
the JWT secret renders all encrypted columns unreadable (this is by design
— it is the kill switch).

The `aes-gcm` crate version pinned in the workspace is `0.10`.

## Per-conversation workspaces

Each conversation owns a directory the agent can freely read and write:

```
{work_dir}/conversations/{label}-temp-{conversation_id}/
```

- `work_dir` — the runtime work directory; falls back to the data dir when
  not set explicitly. Sources, in order: `--work-dir` flag → env
  `NOMIFUN_WORK_DIR` → `<data_dir>`.
- `label` — a short slug derived from the conversation title.
- `temp` — literal string; signals these directories are mutable scratch
  space the user can also drop files into.
- `conversation_id` — the conversation's unique id (UUID v7 with a short
  prefix from `nomifun_common::id`).

The directory is created lazily the first time the conversation needs it.
On conversation deletion the directory is removed (the
`OnConversationDelete` hook in `nomifun_common::hooks`). File operations
inside it are sandboxed and watched:

- [`nomifun-file::path_safety`](../../crates/backend/nomifun-file/src/path_safety.rs)
  rejects paths that escape the workspace (e.g. via `..` or absolute roots).
- [`nomifun-file::watch_service`](../../crates/backend/nomifun-file/src/watch_service.rs)
  uses `notify` to surface filesystem changes back to the SPA over WS.
- [`nomifun-file::snapshot_service`](../../crates/backend/nomifun-file/src/snapshot_service/)
  records before/after snapshots for tool-edit auditability.

The repo enforces an extra constraint via
`nomifun_common::error::workspace_path_has_edge_whitespace_segment`: no
directory name in a workspace path may begin or end with whitespace (or
consist entirely of whitespace). Such names break Win32 path round-tripping
and are visually indistinguishable in any UI. Interior whitespace is fully
supported — the default per-user data dir on macOS
(`~/Library/Application Support/NomiFun/Nomi`) contains a space, and every
process-spawn pipeline passes the workspace as a discrete argument
(`Command::current_dir`, PTY cwd, ACP session JSON), which is
whitespace-safe.

### Knowledge-base mounts (`.nomi/knowledge/`)

When a conversation, terminal session, or companion binding brings knowledge
bases into a workspace, they are mounted under
`{workspace}/.nomi/knowledge/` — the same `.nomi/` domain as project
skills — as junctions/symlinks with a copy fallback, plus a built-in
`.gitignore` so mounts never enter version control. A platform-managed
`README.md` (retrieval protocol, per-base digests + TOC, write-back
rules) is rewritten there on every launch. Legacy mounts under the old
`{workspace}/.nomifun/knowledge/` location are cleaned up automatically
on the next sync.

## Companion data (the `companion/` file domain)

The virtual companion's data deliberately stays **out of the main database's
migration system** — it is a file domain that can be exported or wiped
as a whole (see the [Companions guide](../guides/companions.md)). The multi-companion
layout:

```
<data_dir>/companion/
├── shared/                      shared memory hub (one copy for all companions)
│   ├── config.json              SharedCompanionConfig: collect switches, learn interval & model, default_companion_id
│   ├── events/YYYYMMDD.jsonl    raw events from the collection pipeline (privacy-sensitive; export is opt-in)
│   └── memory.db                standalone SQLite (PRAGMA user_version ladder):
│                                shared memories/suggestions/learn history + per-companion runtime
│                                state (companion_runtime_state: XP, …)
└── companions/
    └── {companion_id}/                companion_{uuid_v7}; the directory is the source of truth
        └── config.json          CompanionProfileConfig: name/character/persona/per-companion model/desktop-companion toggle & position
```

The legacy single-companion layout `companion/nomi/` is migrated automatically on
first boot into `shared/` plus a first companion named "Nomi"; the old
directory gets a `.migrated` marker and is kept around (cleanup after
one release cycle).

Knowledge bases bound to companions do not live in the `companion/` domain: the
bindings are stored in the main database as
`knowledge_bindings('companion', companion_id)`, and the base content lives in the
knowledge bases' own managed directories (URL-sourced bases keep their
fetched markdown snapshots in a `snapshots/` subdirectory there).

## Bundled bun runtime

NomiFun ships its own `bun` runtime (1.3.13) so MCP servers and tool
subprocesses do not require a system Node.js install:

| Step | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Build time | The bun binary for the target OS/arch is **zstd-compressed** and embedded into `nomifun-runtime` via `include_dir!`. |
| First run | `nomifun_runtime::init(&data_dir)` extracts the binary into a **`<data_dir>/runtime/`** subtree (see the runtime-cache details below). |
| Boot | `enhance_process_path()` prepends the bun bin dir to the process `PATH` **before any tokio thread is built** (the order is enforced in both host `main.rs` files). |
| Spawn | `nomifun_runtime::spawn::Builder` produces children with that merged `PATH` so `npx`, `bun`, and other JS tools resolve correctly. |
| Cleanup | `kill_process_tree` cross-platform tree-kills agent / MCP children on cancellation. |

The runtime cache is anchored to the backend's `data_dir`:
[`nomifun_runtime::init(&data_dir)`](../../crates/backend/nomifun-runtime/src/cache.rs)
records `<data_dir>/runtime` as the cache root, so on the desktop the bun
binary extracts under `<data_dir>/runtime/bun-<version>-<sha12>/` —
i.e. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NomiFun\Nomi\runtime\bun-…\` by default on Windows
(the per-user app-data equivalents on macOS/Linux), or
`$NOMIFUN_DATA_DIR/Nomi/runtime/bun-…/` when the env var is set. When
`init` has not been called (the `mcp-*` subcommands, unit tests, `build.rs`)
the cache falls back to the platform cache dir via `dirs::cache_dir()`:
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\nomifun\runtime\` on Windows, `~/Library/Caches/nomifun/runtime/`
on macOS, `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/nomifun/runtime/` (or `~/.cache/nomifun/runtime/`)
on Linux.

## Logs

Logs go to `<data_dir>/logs/` via `tracing-appender`. The default level is
`info`; override with `--log-level` (e.g. `--log-level info,nomifun_mcp=trace`)
or env `RUST_LOG`. The desktop shell additionally keeps a console attached
in debug builds (the release build sets `windows_subsystem = "windows"`).

The logging configuration types — `ResolvedLogging`, `create_file_layer` —
live in `nomi_config::logging` (the agent layer's config crate). The
backend reaches them through the seam: `nomifun_ai_agent::nomi_config::logging::*`.

## First-run state

On a brand-new install the boot sequence is:

```
1. nomifun-runtime::init           extract bun into OS cache
2. enhance_process_path             prepend cache bin dir to PATH
3. bootstrap::init_environment      resolve work_dir / log_dir, init tracing,
                                    take the exclusive {data_dir}/server.lock
4. bootstrap::init_data_layer       open database, run migrations
5. AppServices::from_config         instantiate every service
6. ensure_admin_credentials (web)   pre-seed admin if NOMIFUN_ADMIN_PASSWORD is set
7. create_router → axum::serve      bind and start serving
```

Step 3 is where a second backend on an already-claimed data dir fails fast
(see "One directory, one state" above).

In the desktop shell step 6 is skipped, but the desktop is not the old blanket
`--local` story: it uses `TrustLocalToken` and trusts only its own WebView's
per-boot secret. In the web host, if no admin exists and no
`NOMIFUN_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is set, the install enters **interactive first-run
setup**: the next browser visitor chooses a username and password through
`POST /api/auth/setup`. A warning is logged if first-run setup is exposed on a
non-loopback bind address.

## Backups and reinstall

- **Database** — copy `<data_dir>/nomifun-backend.db` (sqlx single-file SQLite).
- **Encryption key** — nothing separate to copy: the key is derived from the
  JWT secret, which lives in the database (unless supplied via env
  `JWT_SECRET`), so a database copy carries the encrypted columns *and* the
  means to read them.
- **Workspaces** — copy `<work_dir>/conversations/` if you want to keep the
  files agents wrote.
- **Companion data** — copy `<data_dir>/companion/` (shared memory hub + per-companion
  profiles), or use the in-app migration bundles instead (see the
  [Companions guide](../guides/companions.md)).
- **Bun runtime cache** — disposable; will be re-extracted on next boot.

A clean uninstall therefore deletes the data dir, the work dir (if set
separately), and the OS cache dir.
