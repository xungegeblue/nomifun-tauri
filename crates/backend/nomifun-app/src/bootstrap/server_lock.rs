//! Exclusive per-data-dir server lock.
//!
//! Every host (the desktop shell's embedded backend, `nomifun-web`, the
//! `nomicore` bin) defaults to ONE shared data directory (see
//! [`crate::cli::default_data_dir`]). Two live backends on the same directory
//! would double-fire every cron job (each process arms its own timers from
//! the shared DB), fight over channel polling (Telegram allows a single
//! `getUpdates` consumer and the on-disk update watermark is
//! last-writer-wins, reopening the dedup window), interleave writes to the
//! rolling log file, and — worst — race the SQLite corruption-recovery path,
//! which renames a database the other process still holds open.
//!
//! So the server takes an OS-level exclusive lock on `{data_dir}/server.lock`
//! before touching the data layer and holds it for the process lifetime. A
//! second server fails fast with an actionable message instead of silently
//! corrupting shared state.
//!
//! The lock is advisory (`flock` on Unix, `LockFileEx` on Windows, via `fs2`
//! — the same dependency nomifun-db's migrate lock uses) and is released by
//! the OS when the process exits *or crashes*; a leftover `server.lock` FILE
//! is harmless and needs no staleness heuristics. Read-only companions are
//! deliberately unaffected: `nomicore doctor` opens the DB without this lock
//! (it is designed to run while the server is alive), and the `mcp-*` stdio
//! helpers never touch the data dir at all.
