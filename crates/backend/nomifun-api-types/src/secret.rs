//! Browser-use credential secret DTOs (P3-X2).
//!
//! A *secret* is a per-pet stored credential the browser engine can inject via a
//! `secret:NAME` reference (origin-bound, fail-closed). **The plaintext value is
//! write-only over the wire**: it is accepted on register and then encrypted into
//! a machine-bound vault — it is **NEVER** returned by any endpoint, never reaches
//! the LLM, the ref table, or logs (DESIGN §16). Listing therefore carries only the
//! non-sensitive metadata (name + the registrable domains it is bound to), mirroring
//! the webhook `has_secret` convention.
