//! Build channel (`NOMI_CHANNEL`) — the single source of truth that lets a
//! non-stable build (e.g. `dev`) coexist with the installed stable app by
//! deriving a per-channel suffix for the data directory and OS identity.
//!
//! The channel is baked at compile time from the `NOMI_CHANNEL` env var (set by
//! the dev build script); unset means `stable`. Only the exact string `stable`
//! maps to the production data directory — every other value (including typos)
//! gets an isolated suffix, so a mis-set channel can never write into the
//! installed app's state.
