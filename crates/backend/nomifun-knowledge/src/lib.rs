//! `nomifun-knowledge` — the Knowledge Base platform domain: user-curated
//! directories of markdown documents, registered globally and mounted
//! (junction/symlink) into session workspaces as an extended knowledge
//! source. Sessions with the write-back ("回血") switch enabled are told via
//! prompt contract that they may persist new knowledge back into the mounted
//! directories.
//!
//! Layering: `service` owns registry CRUD + file access + mount planning;
//! `mount` is the platform-aware link engine (junction on Windows, symlink on
//! Unix, recursive copy fallback); `routes`/`state` are the `/api/knowledge/*`
//! surface; `events` pushes WS notifications.
//!
//! The directory is the source of truth for content — the database only
//! stores registration metadata, so users may drop `.md` files in at any
//! time. Consumers other than conversations (terminal, companion) reuse the same
//! `(target_kind, target_id)` binding storage; the companion integration is
//! intentionally deferred (no code here depends on conversation or companion).
