//! `nomifun-workshop` — the 创意工坊 (Creative Workshop) domain: an
//! infinite-canvas AI visual-creation workspace.
//!
//! Two backend crates back the domain: this one owns **canvases + assets**
//! (index rows in `nomifun-db`, canvas bodies + asset binaries on disk under
//! the data dir), while `nomifun-creation` owns the generation task queue.
//!
//! Deliberately mirrors the `nomifun-public-agent` crate shape: `fsio` (atomic
//! temp+rename writes), `service` (the single handle the routes talk to),
//! `state`/`routes` (the `/api/workshop/*` surface). The canvas *doc*
//! (nodes/edges/viewport/settings) is a frontend-owned JSON contract. The
//! backend does not duplicate its presentation schema, but it does enforce the
//! durable identity envelope (`wsn_` nodes, `wse_` edges, and node references),
//! caps its size, and derives `node_count` from it.
