//! `nomifun-workshop` — the 创意工坊 (Creative Workshop) domain: an
//! infinite-canvas AI visual-creation workspace.
//!
//! Two backend crates back the domain: this one owns **canvases + assets**
//! (index rows in `nomifun-db`, canvas bodies + asset binaries on disk under
//! the data dir), while `nomifun-creation` owns the generation task queue.
//!
//! Deliberately mirrors the `nomifun-public-agent` crate shape: `fsio` (atomic
//! temp+rename writes), `service` (the single handle the routes talk to),
//! `state`/`routes` (the `/api/workshop/*` surface). The canvas *doc*
//! (nodes/edges/viewport/settings) is **opaque JSON** to the backend — the
//! service only stores it, caps its size, and derives `node_count` from it; the
//! doc's internal shape is a frontend contract.
