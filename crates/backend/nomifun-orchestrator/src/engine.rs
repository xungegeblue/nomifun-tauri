//! [`RunEngine`]: the **bounded-parallel** execution loop that drives an
//! orchestration run's task DAG to completion.
//!
//! The engine skeleton — the per-run handle registry, the `start` =
//! stop-then-spawn dance, the generation-guarded [`HandleGuard`] that removes
//! only its own entry on task exit, and [`RunEngine::resume_persisted_runs`] —
//! is a faithful reduction of `nomifun_requirement::Orchestrator` (see
//! `crates/backend/nomifun-requirement/src/orchestrator.rs`). The differences
//! are deliberate: a run is keyed by a single `String` run id (no dual-domain
//! `(kind, id)`), and the dispatch loop is **concurrent** (P2) — it runs up to
//! `cap` ready tasks at a time on overlapping worker conversations (P1a was
//! serial; P2 lifts the one-at-a-time restriction while keeping dependencies
//! strict).
//!
//! ## Concurrency model (no busy-spin, dependencies strict)
//!
//! In-flight workers are held in a [`futures::stream::FuturesUnordered`]; each
//! future resolves to `(task_id, Result<WorkerOutcome, AppError>)`. The loop:
//!
//! 1. **Cancel check** — cooperative flag set → stop scheduling, break.
//! 2. **Fill** — while `inflight.len() < cap`, re-query
//!    [`list_ready_tasks`](nomifun_db::IRunRepository::list_ready_tasks)
//!    (skipping tasks already in-flight), take up to the free slots, mark each
//!    `running` + emit, resolve member/workspace/brief, and push a worker future.
//!    Re-querying every fill means a downstream task is only ever dispatched
//!    after its blockers have actually reached `done` (which only happens when a
//!    worker completes and `update_task(done)` runs) — **dependency strictness**.
//! 3. **Decide / await** —
//!    - `inflight.is_empty()` (nothing ready AND nothing running) → the task
//!      statuses are conclusive: all `done`/`skipped` → run `completed` (+
//!      aggregated summary), any `failed` → run `failed`, otherwise a "stuck"
//!      graph → break. **break, never spin.**
//!    - otherwise `await inflight.next()` — the loop parks on the next worker to
//!      finish; it never re-loops on an unchanged empty-ready state while work is
//!      in flight. Processing the completion (`done`/`failed` + emit) may unblock
//!      downstream tasks, so the loop re-fills.
//!
//! Because the loop only re-enters its body after either dispatching a task or
//! awaiting an in-flight completion, it cannot busy-spin.

// loop 模式 (UC-1d): the `loop` controller. The lead plans ONE BODY `agent` task
// + ONE `loop` controller task that `depends_on` the body. The controller is
// settled NO-LLM in the fill step (`settle_loop_task`) every time the body
// reaches `done`: it evaluates a stop criterion over the body's `output_summary`
// + iteration count and either
//   - STOPs (criterion met OR the HARD `max_iter` cap reached): marks itself
//     `done`, writing the final body output + iteration count to its summary; or
//   - CONTINUEs (criterion not met AND under the cap): RESETS the body in place
//     (status→`pending`, clear output_summary/conversation_id, attempt+1) and
//     leaves itself `pending`. The body re-enters the normal ready→dispatch→
//     worker→done path; when it completes the controller fires again.
//
// NO-SPIN (the critical invariant): the loop ALWAYS terminates. The HARD
// `max_iter` cap is the backstop — `iterations_done + 1 >= max_iter` forces STOP
// even if the criterion never fires. Each CONTINUE requires a REAL body worker
// run (a `done`→`pending`→worker→`done` cycle = one unit of monotonic progress,
// counted by the body's `attempt`), and `attempt` is strictly bounded by
// `max_iter`. The controller settle is a one-shot per body-completion: after a
// CONTINUE the body is `pending` (un-`done`), so the controller's only blocker is
// no longer `done` and `list_ready_tasks` does NOT return the controller again
// until the body re-completes — there is no path where the controller re-settles
// without the body having re-run, and no path past the cap.
//
// A body that FAILS mid-loop never reaches `done`, so the controller never
// becomes ready by the normal path. `settle_loop_task` is therefore also invoked
// when the body is `failed` (see the fill step's loop branch): it STOPs the loop
// as `failed` and gates (skips) downstream, so a failing body never iterates and
// the run still reaches a clean terminal state.
//
// Like verify/judge the controller is NOT a worker dispatch: it is settled
// SYNCHRONOUSLY in the fill step, never enters the in-flight worker set, and its
// `conversation_id` stays None (there is no worker conversation).
