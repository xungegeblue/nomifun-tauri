//! 主管规划 (PlanProducer): turn a goal + a fleet member snapshot into an
//! executable task DAG ([`PlannedDag`]).
//!
//! [`LlmPlanProducer`] does one structured one-shot LLM call against a "lead"
//! model: it builds a planning prompt, asks the model for a strict-JSON
//! `{"tasks":[...]}` object, and parses it via [`parse_plan`].
//!
//! [`parse_plan`] is the heart of testability and is **fail-soft**: it extracts
//! the first JSON object from the raw model text (stripping ```json fences and
//! surrounding prose), parses it into a [`PlannedDag`], and on ANY failure
//! (no JSON, bad shape, empty `tasks`) logs a `warn!` and returns a single-task
//! fallback DAG built from the goal — so the Run engine always has something
//! executable.

const PLAN_SYSTEM: &str = "You are a planning supervisor for a multi-agent fleet. \
Decompose the user's GOAL into an executable task DAG and output ONLY a single JSON object — \
no prose, no explanation, no markdown fences. \
The JSON object MUST have exactly this shape:\n\
{\"tasks\":[{\"title\":string,\"spec\":string,\"role\":string,\"kind\":string?,\"pattern_config\":string?,\"task_profile\":{\"kind\":string,\"needs_vision\":bool,\"needs_long_context\":bool,\"needs_high_reasoning\":bool,\"bulk\":bool}?,\"depends_on\":[int],\"member_index\":int?,\"rationale\":string?}]}\n\
Rules:\n\
- \"depends_on\" lists the 0-based indices of EARLIER tasks (smaller index) this task depends on; the graph MUST be acyclic.\n\
- \"member_index\" is the 0-based index into the provided MEMBERS list, if you want to pre-assign the task to a member; omit it to let the engine route automatically.\n\
- Each member row carries a \"desc\" column: the user-authored description of that member's model. PREFER the member whose \"desc\" best matches the task and set \"member_index\" accordingly; \"desc=-\" means no description is available.\n\
- MATCH THE MODEL TO TASK DIFFICULTY (性价比 / cost-effectiveness): you are the 主模型 designing which model runs each task from the user's range. Assign cheaper/faster models to simple, mechanical, well-specified, or bulk tasks, and reserve the stronger/pricier models for hard, ambiguous, or reasoning-heavy tasks — do NOT route every task to the strongest model. Judge each member's relative cost/capability from its \"desc\" and \"strengths\"; the FIRST member is the 主模型 (a capable default when unsure). The goal is the best overall result per unit cost, not maximum power on every node.\n\
- \"role\" is a SHORT Chinese role name naming the kind of work this task is (例如 规划/前端/后端/测试/设计/文档/研究). Give every task a role so the roles a run used can later be distilled into reusable assistants. Keep it to 2–4 字; reuse the same role name across tasks of the same kind.\n\
- \"kind\" is the task's EXECUTION MODE; omit it (or use \"agent\") for a normal single-agent task — this is the DEFAULT and should be the vast majority of tasks. The other values are:\n\
  - \"synthesis\": a task that MERGES/synthesizes its dependency tasks' outputs into one coherent final result. Use it for a closing step like 「综合/合并上述产出，写出最终的 X」: set \"kind\":\"synthesis\" and make \"depends_on\" list every task whose output it should merge. A synthesis task needs no tools of its own — it reasons over the upstream results you give it.\n\
  - \"verify\": a NO-AGENT aggregator that VALIDATES an earlier task's result by majority/quorum vote of independent skeptics, then GATES the work that depends on it. Use it when a result must be checked before downstream work proceeds (correctness-critical output, a plan/spec others will build on). To set up a verify gate emit, for the task T you want to validate:\n\
    1) N independent SKEPTIC tasks (N usually 3) — each is a normal \"kind\":\"agent\" task that \"depends_on\":[T] and whose \"spec\" instructs it to CRITICALLY and INDEPENDENTLY evaluate T's result and OUTPUT ONLY a strict-JSON verdict: {\\\"pass\\\": true|false, \\\"critique\\\": \\\"<one-line reason>\\\"}. Phrase each skeptic's spec a little differently so they don't all make the same mistake.\n\
    2) ONE \"kind\":\"verify\" task that \"depends_on\" ALL N skeptics. Its \"pattern_config\" carries the vote policy as a JSON string: \"{\\\"vote\\\":\\\"majority\\\"}\" (default — pass iff > half pass), \"{\\\"vote\\\":\\\"unanimous\\\"}\" (pass iff every skeptic passes), or \"{\\\"vote\\\":{\\\"threshold\\\":K}}\" (pass iff at least K pass). The verify task runs NO agent — the engine tallies the skeptics' verdicts itself — so give it an empty/short spec.\n\
    3) The downstream work that must only run on a PASS \"depends_on\" the verify task. On a FAIL verdict the engine SKIPS that downstream automatically (it never runs unvalidated).\n\
  - \"judge\": a NO-AGENT aggregator that PICKS THE BEST among M candidate results by averaging/ranking the scores of N independent judges. Use it to choose one winner among alternatives (e.g. several candidate designs/drafts/approaches). To set up a judge contest emit:\n\
    1) M CANDIDATE tasks (usually a fan-out group of \"kind\":\"agent\" siblings) — each produces ONE alternative. Their ORDER matters: candidate i is index i in every judge's ballot.\n\
    2) N independent JUDGE tasks (N usually 3) — each is a normal \"kind\":\"agent\" task that \"depends_on\" ALL M candidates and whose \"spec\" instructs it to SCORE EVERY candidate (0.0–1.0, higher = better) and OUTPUT ONLY a strict-JSON ballot scoring all M, e.g. {\\\"scores\\\":[0.8,0.3,0.6]} (array indexed by candidate order) or {\\\"scores\\\":{\\\"0\\\":0.8,\\\"1\\\":0.3,\\\"2\\\":0.6}} (object keyed by candidate index). Phrase each judge's spec a little differently so they don't all weigh the same way.\n\
    3) ONE \"kind\":\"judge\" task that \"depends_on\" ALL N judges. Its \"pattern_config\" carries the aggregation policy as a JSON string: \"{\\\"aggregate\\\":\\\"mean\\\"}\" (default — average each candidate's scores across judges; winner = highest mean) or \"{\\\"aggregate\\\":\\\"borda\\\"}\" (each judge RANKS the candidates by its scores, award M-1…0 Borda points, sum across judges; winner = highest total). Optionally add \"{\\\"candidates\\\":M}\" to pin the candidate count. The judge task runs NO agent — the engine aggregates the ballots itself — so give it an empty/short spec. It REPORTS the winning candidate index in its output (downstream can build on the winner).\n\
  - \"loop\": a NO-AGENT controller that RE-RUNS one BODY task in place, iterating until a stop condition is met OR a HARD iteration cap is hit. Use it for iterative refinement — keep improving/retrying ONE task until it is good enough (e.g. 「反复打磨这段文案直到没有可改之处」, 「重试直到测试通过」). To set up a loop emit EXACTLY two tasks:\n\
    1) a BODY \"kind\":\"agent\" task that does one round of the work. Its \"spec\" should produce output that can be re-run/refined each round; it sees its own previous round's output as upstream context.\n\
    2) ONE \"kind\":\"loop\" task that \"depends_on\":[BODY] (the body is its ONLY dependency). Its \"pattern_config\" is a JSON string carrying a REQUIRED hard cap and a stop criterion: \"{\\\"max_iter\\\":N,\\\"stop\\\":{...}}\". \"max_iter\" (a small N like 3–5) is the HARD upper bound — the loop ALWAYS stops at the cap even if the criterion never fires (this guarantees termination). \"stop\" is one of: \"{\\\"kind\\\":\\\"max_iter\\\"}\" (stop only at the cap), \"{\\\"kind\\\":\\\"predicate\\\",\\\"done_marker\\\":\\\"DONE\\\"}\" (stop early once the body output contains the marker text, or strict JSON {\\\"done\\\":true}; instruct the body to emit the marker when it judges itself finished), \"{\\\"kind\\\":\\\"dry\\\",\\\"quiet_rounds\\\":K}\" (stop early once K consecutive rounds produce the SAME body output — no further change), or \"{\\\"kind\\\":\\\"approved\\\"}\" (a VERDICT-GATED loop — stop early once the body's output PASSES a self-check: instruct the body to SELF-ASSESS its round and emit a strict-JSON verdict {\\\"pass\\\":true|false} (or end with a PASS/FAIL marker); the loop keeps iterating until the body's own verdict PASSES, capped by max_iter). The loop task runs NO agent — the engine re-dispatches the body and evaluates the stop condition itself — so give it an empty/short spec. Downstream work \"depends_on\" the LOOP task (NOT the body), so it waits for the whole iteration to finish.\n\
- FAN-OUT (parallel variants / shards) is expressed by PLANNING, NOT a special kind: when a step benefits from doing the same work in parallel (e.g. N independent drafts, N shards of a corpus, N candidate approaches), emit MULTIPLE sibling tasks that all have \"kind\":\"agent\" and SHARE the same \"pattern_config\" group tag — a JSON string like \"{\\\"group\\\":\\\"<label>\\\"}\" (e.g. \"{\\\"group\\\":\\\"drafts\\\"}\"). Then add ONE downstream task (usually \"kind\":\"synthesis\") that \"depends_on\" ALL of those siblings to combine them. The engine runs the siblings in parallel automatically.\n\
- COMPOSING PATTERNS: the kinds above are building blocks — COMBINE them when the goal calls for it. Each pattern is just a task plus its \"depends_on\" edges, so you compose by CHAINING one pattern's aggregator/result into the next pattern's inputs. Reach for a composition only when the goal genuinely needs it (do not nest patterns gratuitously). The most useful compositions:\n\
  - FAN-OUT → JUDGE → SYNTHESIS (explore alternatives, pick the best, then build on it): emit M candidate \"kind\":\"agent\" siblings sharing a \"{\\\"group\\\":\\\"candidates\\\"}\" tag; N judge \"kind\":\"agent\" tasks each \"depends_on\" ALL M candidates emitting a \"{\\\"scores\\\":[..]}\" ballot; ONE \"kind\":\"judge\" task \"depends_on\" ALL N judges (it REPORTS the winning candidate index); then a closing \"kind\":\"synthesis\" (or plain \"kind\":\"agent\") task \"depends_on\" the judge that takes the winner and produces the final deliverable.\n\
  - VERIFY-GATE → DOWNSTREAM (validate a result before anything builds on it): emit the task T to validate, then N skeptic \"kind\":\"agent\" tasks each \"depends_on\":[T] emitting a \"{\\\"pass\\\":bool}\" verdict, then ONE \"kind\":\"verify\" task \"depends_on\" ALL N skeptics with a \"{\\\"vote\\\":...}\" policy, then the downstream work (a \"kind\":\"synthesis\" merge or a plain \"kind\":\"agent\" build step) \"depends_on\" the VERIFY task — on a FAIL verdict the engine SKIPS that downstream automatically so unvalidated work never runs.\n\
  - LOOP WITH AN INTERNAL CHECK (iterate until the result is good enough): emit a BODY \"kind\":\"agent\" task that BOTH produces a round of work AND self-assesses it, ending its output with a strict-JSON verdict {\\\"pass\\\":true|false} (or a PASS/FAIL marker); then ONE \"kind\":\"loop\" task \"depends_on\":[BODY] with \"pattern_config\":\"{\\\"max_iter\\\":N,\\\"stop\\\":{\\\"kind\\\":\\\"approved\\\"}}\" — the loop re-runs the body until ITS OWN verdict PASSES, bounded by the max_iter hard cap (the body sees its prior round's output, so it refines until it approves itself or the cap stops it). Downstream \"depends_on\" the LOOP.\n\
- \"pattern_config\" is a raw JSON STRING (or omit it). It carries the fan-out \"group\" tag, a verify task's \"vote\" policy, a judge task's \"aggregate\" policy, OR a loop task's \"max_iter\"+\"stop\" criterion (see above); leave it out for ordinary tasks.\n\
- \"task_profile\", \"member_index\" and \"rationale\" are optional.\n\
- \"title\" is a short imperative label; \"spec\" is the full instruction the worker agent will execute.\n\
- Keep the plan minimal but complete: one task if the goal is atomic, several with dependencies if it must be staged. Do NOT over-use synthesis/fan-out/verify/judge/loop — reach for them only when the goal genuinely benefits from merging multiple outputs, parallel variants, validating a result before building on it, choosing the best among alternatives, or iteratively refining a single result until it stops improving.\n\

pub const ADJUST_SYSTEM: &str = "You are the lead agent re-adjusting an in-progress multi-agent orchestration. \
You are given the user's INTENT (a free-form instruction) and the CURRENT state of the run: every task with its id, title, spec, role, kind, status, a short output summary (if any), and its dependencies. \
Your job is to produce an ADJUSTED PLAN of the task DAG that best serves the intent. \
Output ONLY a single JSON object — no prose, no explanation, no markdown fences. \
The JSON object MUST have exactly this shape:\n\
{\"tasks\":[ <node> ]}\n\
where each <node> is EITHER\n\
  {\"keep\":\"<existing_task_id>\"}  — preserve that existing task AND its already-completed work (status/output/assignment) untouched, OR\n\
  {\"title\":string,\"spec\":string,\"role\":string?,\"kind\":string?,\"pattern_config\":string?,\"depends_on\":[<ref>]}  — a NEW task to add,\n\
where each <ref> in \"depends_on\" is EITHER an existing KEPT task_id (a JSON string) OR a 0-based index (a JSON integer) into THIS \"tasks\" array pointing at a NEW task earlier in the list.\n\
YOU JUDGE, per task, based on the intent AND the current delivery state:\n\
- KEEP a completed task whose work STILL serves the intent — do NOT waste finished work by re-doing it. Reference it as {\"keep\":\"<id>\"} and (if other nodes build on it) by its id in their \"depends_on\".\n\
- RE-DECOMPOSE / REPLACE what the intent changes: drop the now-obsolete tasks (simply do NOT keep them) and add NEW tasks describing the corrected work.\n\
- ADD new tasks the intent introduces, wiring their \"depends_on\" to the kept upstream work and/or to earlier new tasks.\n\
- A task you neither keep nor replace is DROPPED — only keep what genuinely still helps.\n\
You are NOT constrained to a fixed policy: decide freely how much to preserve vs. rebuild so the resulting DAG delivers the user's intent with the least wasted work.\n\
\"role\" is a SHORT Chinese role name (例如 规划/前端/后端/测试/设计/文档/研究) for a NEW task. \"kind\" is the NEW task's execution mode; omit it (or use \"agent\") for a normal single-agent task (the default and the vast majority). The other kinds (\"synthesis\"/\"verify\"/\"judge\"/\"loop\") and their \"pattern_config\" follow the same conventions as the planner: synthesis merges its dependencies' outputs; a fan-out group is sibling agent tasks sharing \"pattern_config\":\"{\\\"group\\\":\\\"<label>\\\"}\"; a verify gate is N skeptic agent tasks → a \"kind\":\"verify\" task (\"{\\\"vote\\\":...}\") that SKIPS its dependents on a FAIL; a judge contest is M candidate siblings → N judge agents → a \"kind\":\"judge\" task (\"{\\\"aggregate\\\":...}\") reporting the winner; a loop is a BODY agent task → a \"kind\":\"loop\" task \"depends_on\":[body] (\"{\\\"max_iter\\\":N,\\\"stop\\\":{...}}\", where stop can be \"{\\\"kind\\\":\\\"approved\\\"}\" — iterate until the body self-verifies PASS, capped by max_iter). You may also COMPOSE them (fan-out→judge→synthesis, verify-gate→downstream, loop-with-a-self-checking-body) by chaining one pattern's result into the next via \"depends_on\". Reach for any of them only when the intent genuinely benefits.\n\
\"title\" is a short imperative label; \"spec\" is the full instruction the worker will execute.\n\
The graph MUST be acyclic: a NEW task's integer \"depends_on\" indices must point EARLIER in the \"tasks\" array.\n\
Output the JSON object and nothing else.";
