//! `nomifun-public` — the **Remote 前门** (external companion surface).
//!
//! Projects the platform's single capability source of truth
//! (`nomifun_gateway::Registry`) onto a network-reachable, companion-token-
//! authenticated **MCP Streamable-HTTP** endpoint, so an external AI agent
//! (Claude Code / Cursor / a custom LLM agent) — i.e. an "外部伙伴" — can drive
//! the platform exactly as the desktop companion does, over `Surface::Remote`.
//!
//! This crate is deliberately thin: it owns transport + auth + identity only.
//! Every capability, its schema, its danger tier and its surface gate already
//! live in `nomifun-gateway`; adding a capability there makes it appear here
//! automatically (the inheritance guarantee — see the design spec §2.1). It MUST
//! be mounted in-process by `nomifun-app` (the `server.lock` data-dir is
//! single-writer; a sidecar is impossible).
