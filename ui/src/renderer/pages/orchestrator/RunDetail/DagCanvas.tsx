 * Height` to the rendered DOM *before first measurement* and then defers to the

    // `getEdgePosition` fails `isNodeInitialized` → the edge renders null and,

    // WHY declaring handles alone made them JITTER on click: react-flow keeps
    // measuring the real `<Handle>` DOM and OVERWRITES `internals.handleBounds`
    // via the ResizeObserver, while every re-adopt rebuilds them from the
    // DECLARED array — so the endpoint flips between the two whenever they differ.
