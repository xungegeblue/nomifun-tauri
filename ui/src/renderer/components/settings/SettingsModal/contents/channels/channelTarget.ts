 * multi-bot flows:
 * - `channelId` present → update that row (`achn_` prefixed id, or a legacy
 *   platform-name id migrated from the single-bot era);
 * - `channelId` absent → create mode: the first enable creates a new row of
 *   the form's platform bound to its owner (backend rejects with 409 when the
 *   same bot is already bound to another owner).
 *
 * The bind owner is EITHER a desktop companion (`companionId`) OR a public
 * agent (`publicAgentId`) — exactly one is set; they are mutually exclusive
 * (a channel bot serves a single object). The enable call forwards whichever
 * one is present as `companion_id` / `public_agent_id`.
 *
 * Forms that receive no `channelTarget` keep the legacy global-settings
 * behavior (one implicit row per platform, addressed by platform name).
